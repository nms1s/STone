Stone is a program that takes a "Bible" the user has written of whatever profession they want to explore
and randomly chooses two topics for each day for the person to work on.

    For example, if the user wants to become a great Python programmer, he will need to make a tree of all topics (Data Types)
    and their subtopics (Lists, Strings, Tuples) that will need to be learned in order to acheive the goal.
    This is what we call the User's Bible.
    Stone will take the User's Bible and carefully pick two objectives for the user to work on.
    Stone will then generate a session document (properly dated) and record the assigned topics given to the user.
    Stone will also keep a journal and log progress for that day, asking questions such as:
        What did you learn today?
        Was there anything that didn't make sense? (Will add it to a list of things for further exploration)
        etc.
        These questions can be customized to better fit whatever the person is trying to learn. 


USER'S BIBLE:
 The Bible will be created at the first interaction with Stone and can be completed overtime.
 Stone doesn't expect the user to come up with a Bible during the first session and therefore makes it easy to add onto it. 

 A general template of the Bible will be offered to the user at the beginning, although if chosen it can be ignored. 

LOGIN:
Stone comes with a login system to add more privacy to your notes that is also optional.
